This isn't just another app \- it's a strategic revenue engine that positions RBC as the leader in customer financial health."

**Vision (45 seconds):** "Our vision is to transform how customers manage their financial wellness while strategically introducing them to RBC's full product suite. By leveraging their real RBC data and providing genuine value first, we create natural opportunities to cross-sell our financial products when customers are most receptive."

**Three-Phase Approach (2 minutes):**

* **Phase 1:** "We're front-loading requirements and architecture to prevent costly rework. Three months of intensive stakeholder workshops will include product teams to ensure seamless integration pathways for RBC offerings."  
* **Phase 2:** "Twelve months of agile development where we build trust through real customer value, then strategically introduce relevant RBC products. We're not selling \- we're helping customers achieve their goals with our solutions."  
* **Phase 3:** "Controlled launch starting with 1,000 pilot customers, measuring both engagement and cross-sell conversion rates, scaling to our full customer base."

**Key Cross-Selling Differentiators (45 seconds):** "**Gamified Savings** will naturally introduce customers to RBC savings products and investment opportunities as they progress through challenges. **Financial Education** will contextually present relevant RBC products \- like introducing GICs when customers are learning about safe investments, or credit cards when discussing credit building."

**Success Metrics (30 seconds):** "We're targeting 200,000 active users generating $25M in incremental revenue through a 20% increase in cross-sell conversion rates. When customers trust us with their financial wellness, they trust us with their financial products."

**Key Addition for Cross-Selling Context:** The gamification and education features now serve a dual purpose \- providing genuine customer value while creating natural moments to introduce RBC products when customers are most engaged and receptive to learning about financial solutions.

This comprehensive risk management approach addresses the three most critical threats to project success while providing clear, actionable mitigation strategies and contingency plans.

I've created a visually compelling **Risk Management Strategy slide** with a unique "Triple-Layer Defense Framework" concept. Here's the **presentation script** for this slide (4-minute timeframe):

## **Presentation Script for Slide 3:**

**Opening with Visual Impact (30 seconds):** "Our risk management strategy is built like a security shield with three defensive layers protecting our $25M revenue target. Think of it as Prevention, Detection, and Response \- each layer reinforces the others to ensure project success."

**Triple-Layer Defense Concept (45 seconds):** "The outer layer focuses on **Prevention** \- building compliance into every sprint, creating immediate customer value, and front-loading technical architecture. The middle layer is **Detection** \- weekly risk monitoring, real-time early warning indicators, and continuous stakeholder feedback. The inner layer is **Response** \- rapid escalation processes, pre-built contingency plans, and alternative approaches ready to deploy."

**The Three Critical Risks (2 minutes):**

\*\*"First, Regulatory Compliance \- our highest-impact risk. Banking regulations could halt this project or cost us $50M in penalties. Our defense: we've embedded compliance officers directly in sprint teams, not as gatekeepers but as partners. Weekly regulatory reviews ensure we stay compliant while maintaining velocity. We've built 4-week compliance buffers and established proactive relationships with regulators."

\*\*"Second, Customer Adoption \- the make-or-break risk for our $25M revenue target. Our defense: real RBC data creates immediate value from day one \- no manual entry, no learning curve. Our 25-customer advisory panel validates every feature before development, and our phased launch has clear success thresholds. If we don't hit 70% adoption in pilot, we pivot immediately."

\*\*"Third, Core Banking Integration \- lower probability but significant impact. Integration failure could delay us 12 months. Our defense: dedicated 3-month architecture phase to test everything upfront, multiple integration approaches ready, and manual backup options if needed."

**Monitoring & Response Framework (30 seconds):** "We monitor risks continuously \- daily sprint check-ins, weekly risk register updates, monthly steering committee dashboards, and real-time early warning indicators. This isn't annual risk assessment \- it's living, breathing risk management."

**Success Metrics (15 seconds):** "Our targets: Zero regulatory violations, 70%+ pilot adoption, 99.9% system uptime, and 48-hour maximum issue resolution. These aren't aspirational \- they're commitments."

**Key Messaging:**

* **Proactive, not reactive** risk management  
* **Multiple layers of defense** for each critical risk  
* **Continuous monitoring** with rapid response capability  
* **Clear success criteria** with measurable targets

The shield visual metaphor makes the complex risk framework memorable and demonstrates comprehensive protection of the business value. The three-layer concept shows depth of planning while the specific mitigation strategies prove you've thought through practical implementation.

## **Expected Steering Committee Questions & Responses:**

### **"Why did you choose these three as the MAJOR risks? What about other risks?"**

**Strong Response:** "We conducted a comprehensive risk assessment across 15+ risk categories using impact vs. probability analysis. These three rose to the top because:

* **Regulatory Compliance:** Unique to banking, can shut down the project entirely  
* **Customer Adoption:** Directly threatens our $25M revenue target and ROI  
* **Core Banking Integration:** Foundational to our value proposition \- without real data, we're just another budgeting app

**Other risks we considered but ranked lower:**

* **Budget overruns:** Mitigated by agile cost controls and phase-gate budgeting  
* **Team turnover:** Lower impact due to agile methodology and knowledge sharing  
* **Competitive response:** Actually validates market opportunity  
* **Technology changes:** 18-month timeline too short for major tech disruption"

---

### **"How confident are you in your probability assessments?"**

**Strong Response:** "Our probability assessments are based on:

**Regulatory Compliance (Medium-High):** RBC's history with digital product launches, current regulatory environment, and complexity of real-time data usage

**Customer Adoption (Medium):** Digital banking adoption rates in Canada, RBC's existing customer engagement metrics, and success rates of financial wellness apps in banking

**Core Banking Integration (Low-Medium):** Reduced significantly by our 3-month architecture phase \- most integration projects fail due to insufficient planning, which we've addressed

We validate these monthly as we learn more, and adjust mitigation investments accordingly."

---

### **"What if multiple risks materialize simultaneously?"**

**Strong Response:** "We've modeled combination scenarios:

**Worst Case Scenario (Compliance \+ Adoption Issues):**

* Timeline extension: 6 months  
* Additional budget: $3M  
* Reduced scope: Focus on core budgeting features only  
* Still achievable: $15M revenue (reduced but positive ROI)

**Our combination risk triggers:**

* If any two major risks elevate to 'high probability' simultaneously  
* Automatic escalation to CEO level  
* Pre-approved contingency budget of $2M  
* Alternative delivery models ready (simpler features, longer timeline)"

---

### **"How do we know your mitigation strategies will actually work?"**

**Strong Response:** "Each mitigation strategy is based on proven approaches:

**Compliance:** Embedded compliance model used successfully by RBC in recent digital initiatives **Adoption:** Customer advisory panel approach mirrors successful product launches at other major banks **Integration:** 3-month architecture phase is industry best practice for complex system integration

\*\*We're not guessing \- we're applying proven methodologies. Plus, we have measurable success indicators at 30, 60, and 90 days to validate effectiveness and pivot if needed."

---

### **"What about risks we haven't thought of? Unknown unknowns?"**

**Strong Response:** "Great question. Our approach for unknown risks:

**Early Warning System:**

* Weekly 'risk identification' sessions with rotating team members  
* Monthly external expert review (cybersecurity, regulatory, customer experience)  
* Quarterly competitive landscape assessment

**Built-in Flexibility:**

* 15% contingency budget specifically for unforeseen issues  
* Agile methodology allows rapid pivots  
* Feature prioritization framework \- we can cut scope without killing value

**Learning Culture:**

* Every sprint retrospective includes 'what surprised us?'  
* Cross-industry best practice monitoring  
* Regular stakeholder 'what keeps you up at night?' sessions"

---

### **"Why not just accept these risks? Is the mitigation worth the cost?"**

**Strong Response:** "Let me show you the cost-benefit:

**Cost of Mitigation:** \~$1.5M (embedded compliance officers, customer advisory panel, extended architecture phase)

**Cost of Risk Materialization:**

* Regulatory violation: $5-50M in fines  
* Poor adoption: $25M revenue loss \+ $10M sunk investment  
* Integration failure: $2-5M additional costs \+ 12-month delay

**ROI of Risk Management:** 10:1 minimum return on mitigation investment

**Alternative:** We could 'wing it' and save $1.5M upfront, but we'd be gambling a $35M business case on hope. In banking, that's not prudent risk management."

---

### **"How do we know you're not over-engineering the risk management?"**

**Strong Response:** "Fair challenge. We balanced comprehensiveness with practicality:

**What we're NOT doing:**

* Creating bureaucratic approval processes  
* Slowing down development with excessive controls  
* Building mitigation for low-impact risks

**What we ARE doing:**

* Embedding risk management in existing processes (sprint reviews, stakeholder meetings)  
* Focusing mitigation investment on the three risks that could kill the project  
* Using proven methodologies, not experimental approaches

**The test:** Our risk management adds 8% to project cost but reduces project failure probability from 35% to under 10%. That's efficient risk management, not over-engineering."

---

### **"What's your backup plan if ALL mitigation strategies fail?"**

**Strong Response:** "If all primary mitigation fails, we have a **Project Preservation Strategy:**

**Phase 1 Preservation (Months 1-6):**

* Pivot to basic budgeting tool with manual data entry  
* Reduces scope by 70% but preserves core customer value  
* Budget requirement: $4M instead of $10M

**Phase 2 Integration (Year 2):**

* Solve integration issues with extended timeline  
* Gradual feature rollout as problems are resolved  
* Estimated revenue: $10M (delayed but positive)

**Nuclear Option:**

* Sell developed platform to fintech partner  
* Recover $3-5M of investment  
* Learn valuable lessons for future digital initiatives

\*\*We'd rather have backup plans we never use than face project failure without options."

## **Presentation Script for Slide 4:**

**Opening with ROI Impact (30 seconds):** "Let's talk numbers. We're investing $10M to generate $25M in revenue \- a 2.5x return on investment with break-even at Month 14\. This isn't just a technology project, it's a strategic revenue engine with measurable financial impact."

**Investment Allocation Strategy (60 seconds):** "Our $10M investment is strategically allocated: 60% on personnel because this is fundamentally about people \- developers, compliance officers, and customer engagement specialists. 25% on technology infrastructure to ensure scalability and security. 10% on external expertise where we need specialized knowledge. And crucially, 5% contingency buffer because in banking, we plan for the unexpected.

This isn't spending \- it's investing in capabilities that will generate revenue for years beyond this project."

**Revenue Generation Framework (75 seconds):** "Our $25M revenue target comes from three proven streams:

**$15M from incremental deposits** \- when customers see their spending patterns and set savings goals through our gamified challenges, they save more. We're targeting a 15% increase in customer deposit balances.

**$7M from strategic cross-selling** \- by providing genuine financial value first, we create natural moments to introduce relevant RBC products. When someone achieves a savings goal, we might suggest a GIC. When they're learning about credit, we present our credit card options.

**$3M from cost avoidance** \- self-service financial guidance reduces call center volume. Customers get answers instantly instead of waiting on hold."

**Success Measurement (60 seconds):** "We're tracking success at multiple levels. **200,000 monthly active users** generating **$125 revenue per user annually**. **20% increase in cross-sell** for app users versus control groups. **65% feature adoption rate** showing customers use multiple features, not just one.

But we're also measuring operational excellence \- **4.5+ app store rating** and **99.9% uptime** because customer experience drives revenue."

**Financial Control Framework (30 seconds):** "We maintain control through agile financial tracking \- real-time budget dashboards, bi-weekly sprint cost analysis, monthly revenue tracking, and quarterly ROI validation. No financial surprises, no budget overruns."

**Financial Confidence (15 seconds):** "**Break-even at Month 14** during our pilot phase means we're generating positive return before full launch. That's financial confidence in our approach."

**Key Messaging:**

* **Clear ROI:** 2.5x return with specific break-even timeline  
* **Strategic Investment:** Money allocated based on value creation  
* **Diversified Revenue:** Multiple income streams reduce risk  
* **Measurable Success:** Specific, trackable metrics at every level  
* **Financial Control:** Agile cost management prevents overruns

The slide emphasizes that this is a **strategic financial investment** with clear returns, not just a technology expense. The visual balance between costs and revenues shows the steering committee exactly how their $10M creates $25M in value.

**Opening with Structure (30 seconds):** "Excellence requires structure. Our governance model creates clear accountability while enabling agile delivery. Think of it as a three-tier pyramid \- strategic oversight at the top, tactical coordination in the middle, and operational excellence at the base."

**Three-Tier Governance Explanation (75 seconds):** "**Strategic Level:** Our steering committee meets monthly for major decisions and budget approvals over $500K. The executive sponsor provides daily strategic oversight with weekly reviews. The customer advisory board gives us quarterly market validation \- ensuring we're building what customers actually want.

**Tactical Level:** The PMO coordinates daily activities and resource management. Our Architecture Review Board ensures technical standards and security. The Change Control Board manages scope and budget impacts \- no surprises, no scope creep.

**Operational Level:** Cross-functional agile teams with embedded compliance and security specialists execute daily. Customer feedback integration happens every sprint, not at the end. This is where the actual work gets done with excellence."

**Banking-Specific Agile (45 seconds):** "We've adapted agile for banking realities. Compliance review happens parallel to development, not as gates that slow us down. Risk-based prioritization ensures we tackle the highest-value, lowest-risk features first. Privacy-by-design and continuous audit readiness are built into every sprint. We're agile AND compliant."

**Continuous Improvement Framework (45 seconds):** "Learning happens at three levels: **Sprint-level** bi-weekly retrospectives capture immediate lessons. **Release-level** monthly assessments track feature performance and development velocity. **Strategic-level** quarterly reviews assess business value and build organizational capabilities.

We're not just delivering a platform \- we're building RBC's future digital delivery capabilities."

**Success Metrics & Long-term Impact (15 seconds):** "We measure governance success: 48-hour average decision time, 95% stakeholder satisfaction, 5+ process improvements per month. But the real value is long-term \- enhanced digital maturity, agile adoption, innovation culture, and change readiness that benefits RBC for years beyond this project."

**Key Messaging:**

* **Clear Structure:** Three-tier governance provides accountability without bureaucracy  
* **Banking-Adapted Agile:** Compliance and security built in, not bolted on  
* **Continuous Learning:** Improvement happens at every level, continuously  
* **Future Capability:** Building organizational skills for digital transformation  
* **Measurable Governance:** Success metrics ensure governance effectiveness

**Closing Connection:** "This governance framework doesn't just deliver a $25M platform \- it builds RBC's capability to deliver future digital innovations faster, better, and with less risk."

The slide demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how to scale agile in a large banking organization while building lasting organizational capabilities. The pyramid visual makes the governance structure memorable and shows clear lines of authority and accountability.

## **Presentation Script for Slide 6:**

**Opening with Opportunity (30 seconds):** "We stand at a strategic decision point. The opportunity before us is clear: invest $10M to generate $25M in revenue over 18 months while positioning RBC as the leader in digital financial wellness. This isn't just a technology project \- it's a competitive advantage."

**Strategic Commitments (60 seconds):** "Let me be crystal clear about our commitments:

**Customer Value First** \- Real RBC data means customers see immediate value from day one, no manual data entry, no learning curve.

**Risk-Controlled Delivery** \- Compliance is embedded in every sprint, not a gate that slows us down. Zero regulatory violations is non-negotiable.

**Measurable Success** \- 200,000 active users, 65% engagement rate, 4.5+ app store rating. These aren't aspirations, they're commitments.

**Financial Discipline** \- Break-even at Month 14, real-time budget tracking, and scope flexibility to stay on budget and timeline."

**Clear Value Exchange (45 seconds):** "Here's what we're asking for versus what we're delivering:

**We need:** $10M budget authorization, an executive sponsor with decision authority, 500 employee volunteers for testing, and marketing campaign alignment.

**We deliver:** $25M incremental revenue, market-leading financial wellness platform, 20% increase in cross-sell opportunities, and enhanced digital transformation capabilities that benefit RBC for years beyond this project."

**Immediate Action Plan (30 seconds):** "Upon approval, we move immediately: Week 1-2, project kickoff and team formation. Months 1-3, comprehensive requirements and architecture. Month 4, first working prototype with real RBC data. Throughout, monthly steering committee reviews with full transparency."

**Call to Action (15 seconds):** "RBC has the opportunity to lead digital financial wellness in Canada. The question isn't whether we can afford to do this project \- it's whether we can afford not to. The market window is open now."

## **How to Handle the Approval Moment:**

**After your presentation, pause and say:** "I'd like to open this for your questions and discussion. Our recommendation is to approve this project and begin immediate execution. What questions do you have?"

**Be Prepared For:**

* **Budget concerns:** "The 2.5x ROI and Month 14 break-even make this financially compelling"  
* **Timeline questions:** "18 months is aggressive but achievable with our risk-controlled agile approach"
